Hey everyone, it's KlyxR here, sharing the Xbox 360 ABadAvatar.

Step 1: Unzip "ALL CONTENT" and "BadUpdatePayload" onto your USB drive formatted as FAT32 (REQUIRED)
Step 2: Insert the USB drive into your Xbox 360 and turn on your console.
Step 3: Once you launch it, don't touch anything. If it asks for a username, enter one.
Step 4: After step 3, the launcher will start and allow you to launch your .GOD games.
Step 5: You're done. If you need ISO2GOD, it will be in this "I2G" .txt file.
